aBi Finance Wows at Sankalp Conference
The aBi Finance T eam, under the leader -
ship of the Chief Executive Officer, Mona 
Muguma Ssebuliba, took part in the 
Sankalp Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. 
It was running from February 27 to March 
1. The conference served as a pivotal plat -
form for discussing pressing issues con -
cerning climate change and its profound 
impact on Uganda’s agribusiness sector. 
Among the delegation were Ann Marie 
Mwaka, the head of Business Development 
at aBi Finance, Lawrence Mutumba, an 
Investment Manager and Joseph Kibuuka, 
the head of Fund Management , each con -
tributing valuable insights and expertise 
to the discussions. 
Together, they delved into the sobering 
realities facing Uganda, with the nation 
ranking highly vulnerable to climate 
change and grappling with limited adap -
tive capacity. With Uganda positioned 
10th globally in vulnerability and 155th 
in adaptive capacity out of 182 countries, 
urgent action is imperative. 
“The agriculture sector, vital to Uganda’s 
economy, faces significant risks, with vul -
nerability and risk levels rated alarmingly high. The potential costs of inaction loom 
large, with projections indicating annual 
expenses could soar into the billions 
within the next decade,” said Mona at the 
investor round table conversation. 
Key challenges identified by the aBi 
Finance Team included the lack of tailored 
financial products, limited awareness among financial institutions and clients, 
and insufficient staff capacity to man -
age climate change adaptation loans. 
By addressing these issues head-on, the 
team aimed to increase their capitation 
to safeguard Uganda’s agricultural future 
and foster resilience in the face of climate 
uncertainty.MONTHLYNewsletterShamba Shape Up Final Cut Done

Impact In a significant step towards addressing 
the potential impact of the European 
Union Deforestation Regulations (EUDR) 
on Uganda’s coffee industry, aBi convened 
the first joint stakeholder meeting on the 
matter.
The meeting, held on February 14, 2024, 
brought together key officials and stake -
holders from various sectors, including 
representatives from the Uganda Coffee 
Development Authority, TradeMark Africa, 
MasterCard Foundation and Cafe Africa, 
among others. The primary focus of the 
gathering was to initiate discussions on 
how the EUDR could affect Uganda’s coffee 
sector and explore potential strategies to 
mitigate any adverse effects.
During the meeting, participants engaged 
in fruitful discussions on the implications 
of the EUDR and its potential ramifica -
tions for Uganda’s coffee industry. They 
exchanged insights and perspectives on 
the regulatory requirements imposed by 
the EU and examined the implications 
for coffee producers, exporters, and other 
stakeholders along the value chain.
The discussions underscored the impor -
tance of proactive measures to ensure 
compliance with the EUDR while safe -
guarding the interests of Uganda’s coffee 
industry. Participants highlighted the need for coordinated efforts and collabora -
tion among stakeholders to address the 
regulatory challenges posed by the new 
EU legislation.
The meeting also provided an opportuni -
ty for stakeholders to voice their concerns, 
raise pertinent questions, and explore 
possible solutions to mitigate the impact 
of the EUDR on Uganda’s coffee sector.
Following the productive deliberations, 
aBi Development announced plans to 
convene a larger multistakeholder engage -
ment later in the month.

2aBi Visits Partners Across Uganda
aBi Development, a leading player in 
Uganda’s agricultural sector, recently 
embarked on a series of exploratory tours 
to tap into the agricultural potential of 
Northern and Southwestern Uganda. 
These strategic visits aimed to uncover 
opportunities for sustainable agriculture 
and agribusiness initiatives while fostering 
collaboration with local stakeholders.
Northern Uganda Expedition: Unveiling 
Opportunities for Transformation
Traversing the fertile lands of Northern 
Uganda, aBi’s team embarked on a journey 
to envision the Northern Uganda Cluster. 
Engaging with key players in the agri -
cultural landscape, the team explored 
cooperative unions, farming enterprises, 
and agricultural initiatives dedicated to 
sustainable practices.
Discussions at Technoserve revolved 
around mechanization to address the 
region’s growing agricultural service de -
mand, setting the tone for further engage -
ments. Interactions with entities like West 
Acholi Cooperative Union and Hortifresh 
unveiled a tapestry of opportunities, em -
phasizing cooperative collaborations and 
innovative farming practices.
Insights from Syngenta, GADC, and Mob -
byPay shed light on the evolving agricul -
tural development landscape, highlighting 
the need for agromachinery and financial 
support. The culmination of the expedition 
saw commitments from stakeholders like 
PostBank and Uganda Breweries Ltd to 
finance ventures and guarantee demand 
for agricultural commodities.
Immersing themselves in the vibrant cul -
ture of Northern Uganda, the team savored 
a traditional Bwola dance, symbolizing 
unity and community spirit. Energized and 
inspired, the expedition reaffirmed aBi’s 
commitment to sustainable agriculture, 
with findings shaping the 2024/28 Busi -
ness Plan.
Exploring Agricultural Enterprises in 
Southwestern Uganda
Meanwhile, aBi Development delved into 
the agricultural heartland of southwestern 
Uganda, led by CEO Moses Nyabila. The 
tour, conducted last week, provided in -
sights into a diverse range of agricultural 
enterprises, fostering collaboration and partnership opportunities.
Visits to Ankole Coffee Producers Coop -
erative (ACPCU), Rwenjeru Mixed Farm, and 
TASS Women’s Initiative offered unique 
perspectives on coffee production, mixed 
farming, and women’s empowerment ini -
tiatives. Engaging with local stakeholders, 
the team explored market access, value 
addition, and sustainable practices.These expeditions serve as a testament 
to aBi’s commitment to unlocking Uganda’s 
agricultural potential and driving positive 
change. 
By fostering collaboration and sharing 
insights, aBi aims to catalyze sustainable 
agriculture and agribusiness initiatives, 
ensuring a brighter future for Uganda’s 
agricultural sector. 3aBi Finance recently conducted a training 
session at Igara-Buhweju SACCOs, aimed 
at bolstering their financial re-engineering 
and business continuity planning efforts. 
The engagement with staff and board 
members delved into critical strategies to 
navigate challenges faced by the SACCOs, 
particularly amidst shifting dynamics in 
the tea sector.
During the training, it was revealed that 
a significant portion of Igara-Buhweju 
SACCOs’ portfolio, estimated at over 85%, 
is concentrated among just two major 
clients. 
These clients, primarily associated with 
a garbage shooting factory and Igara tea 
factory, respectively, constitute the back -
bone of the SACCOs’ clientele. However, 
recent developments in the tea industry, 
including a drastic drop in tea prices from 
over 750 to 150 shillings per kilogram, 
have posed significant challenges.
With the decline in tea prices impact -
ing the financial stability of their primary 
clients, Igara-Buhweju SACCOs are now facing the prospect of loan repayment 
difficulties. In response, they are exploring 
loan restructuring options to mitigate po -
tential losses and sustain their operations 
amidst the turbulent market conditions.
The financial re-engineering training 
conducted by aBi aimed to provide the 
SACCOs with strategic direction and guid -
ance in navigating these challenges. 
By equipping them with essential skills 
and insights, aBi seeks to empower 
Igara-Buhweju SACCOs to chart a resilient 
path forward and safeguard their long-
term sustainability in the face of industry 
uncertainties.
The training underscores aBi’s com -
mitment to supporting the growth and 
resilience of agricultural cooperatives 
and financial institutions, ensuring their 
continued effectiveness in driving positive 
socio-economic impact within their com -
munities. 
Following the productive deliberations, 
aBi Development announced plans to 
convene a larger multistakeholder engage -
ment later in the month.

In a significant stride towards promoting 
and increasing the uptake of green finance 
products and services, aBi Finance kicked 
off the dissemination of Green Finance In -
formation, Education, and Communication 
(IEC) materials in the first quarter of 2024.  
This initiative aimed to equip financial 
institutions with essential resources and 
information to support eco-friendly agri -
cultural ventures across Uganda.
The comprehensive range of IEC materi -
als included wallboards, brochures, stick -
ers, pull-up banners, and short videos, stra -
tegically designed to raise awareness and 
provide guidance on green agribusiness 
financing. With a focus on promoting en -
vironmentally sustainable practices within 
the agricultural sector, these resources 
aimed to empower financial institutions to 
make informed decisions and extend sup -
port to green initiatives.
The dissemination reached a remarkable 
milestone, with over 1,000 branches of 60 
financial institutions across Central, North -
ern, Eastern, and Western Uganda receiving 
the Green Agribusiness Finance IEC materi -
als. This extensive outreach underscored 
aBi Finance’s commitment to fostering sustainable development and promoting 
green financing solutions.
The initiative not only served to raise 
awareness but also fostered collabora -
tion and partnership among stakeholders 
within the agricultural value chain. By 
equipping financial institutions with the 
knowledge and resources to support green 
agribusiness initiatives, aBi Finance aimed 
to catalyse positive change and drive sustainable development across Uganda’s 
agricultural landscape.
As the dissemination of these green 
finance IEC materials was done in partner -
ship with UBA, UIBFS and AMFIU, through 
such collaborative efforts and strategic 
initiatives, aBi envisions a future where 
green financing is playing a pivotal role 
in driving holistic growth and resilience 
within the agricultural and financial sector.
4In a bid to promote financial inclusion and 
economic empowerment among vulnerable 
refugee and host communities in Northern 
Uganda, aBi Finance has forged a strategic 
partnership with Vision Fund. 
The collaborative initiative, launched on 
March 31, 2023, aims to expand access to 
financial services and uplift the socio-
economic well-being of individuals and 
communities in Lamwo (Palabek) and 
Agago Districts.
With a total project cost of USh1.3Bn, 
aBi Finance and Vision Fund Uganda have 
pooled resources to drive impactful inter -
ventions in the target areas. aBi Finance’s 
contribution stands at 72%, amounting to 
USh943Mn, while Vision Fund Uganda has 
committed 28%, equivalent to USh369Mn.Key activities supported under the part -
nership include the establishment of two 
branches in Agago and Lamwo Districts, 
officially launched on 4th and 5th March 
2024 respectively. These branches serve as 
vital hubs for delivering financial services 
and fostering community engagement.
Additionally, the initiative encompasses 
comprehensive financial education pro -
grams tailored for 720 refugee groups and 
Train-the-Trainer sessions aimed at build -
ing capacity within the community. Market -
ing, promotion, and sensitization, including 
the procurement of 12 motorcycles, further 
enhance outreach and accessibility to 
financial services in the target areas.
The project builds upon the success of 
a similar endeavor implemented by aBi Finance and Vision Fund Uganda in Moyo 
and Yumbe from 2019 to 2021. Leveraging 
collaborative efforts from various partners, 
including those involved in mobilization 
and training of Village Savings and Loan 
Associations, the initiative aims to create 
a ripple effect of positive socio-economic 
change within the communities served.
By focusing on disadvantaged house -
holds, particularly women who constitute 
the majority of VSLA members, the project 
holds promise in alleviating poverty. 
Through concerted efforts and innova -
tive approaches, aBi Finance and Vision 
Fund Uganda are committed to driving 
meaningful impact and catalyzing posi -
tive transformation in Northern Uganda’s 
refugee and host communities.

Dem Commercial Farmers Ltd and aBi 
Development are promoting sustainable 
agriculture and effective waste management 
in Mityana District.
This innovative initiative revolves around 
the conversion of poultry waste into 
organic fertiliser, offering a sustainable 
solution to two pressing issues facing the 
agricultural sector: waste management 
and soil fertility enhancement.
By harnessing the potential of poultry 
waste, Dem and aBi Development are not 
only addressing environmental concerns 
associated with waste disposal but also 
contributing to the promotion of sustain -
able agricultural practices.
The project holds immense promise 
for the agricultural sector, as it offers a 
sustainable alternative to conventional 
chemical fertilisers while addressing the challenge of poultry waste management.
Through the conversion process, poultry 
waste is transformed into nutrient-rich 
organic fertiliser, which can be utilised 
to nourish crops and improve soil health. 
This not only reduces reliance on synthetic fertilisers but also promotes soil fertility 
and enhances crop yields.
It is expected to not only benefit the 
local community in Mityana but also serve 
as a model for similar initiatives across the 
country.
