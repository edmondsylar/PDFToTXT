Godfrey Serunkuma Lule
Godfrey Serunkuma Lule  (Born 10 September 1932) is a
Ugandan  lawyer. He was Minister of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs of Uganda  for Idi Amin  and defected, becoming a
prominent international critic of Amin. He went on to found the
prominent Ugandan Law and Consulting firm Sebalu & Lule
Advocates and Legal Consultants.[1][2]
Lule was born on 10 September 1932, in Mukono , Uganda .[2] born
to Buganda  ethnicity.[3]
From 1952 to 1954, Lule attended Aggrey Memorial School. He
worked briefly as a teacher following graduation, teaching at the
Luwule Secondary School in Luwule Village in the Namaiba
Parish in the Nakisunga Subcounty in the Mukono District  of
Uganda .[4][2] From 1956 to 1961 he attended the University of
Bombay , now called the University of Mumbai  where he obtained
a Bachelor of Laws .[2][5]
After graduating from the University of Bombay , Lule served as
an apprentice to the Attorney General of India  at the office in
Mysore , India .[2] He then  returned to Uganda in 1962 having
passed the bar exam  in India  at this point.[6][1][2] He passed the
bar examination  of Uganda  in 1967.[6]Early life
Education
Early career
CareerBuganda Attorney
General, TeacherLule first entered Ugandan politics  in 1963, when he began
working for the State Attorney at the Ministry of Justice and
Constitutional Affairs  of Uganda . In 1964, he serv ed in his first
appointed position, appointed by Apollo Milton Obote  to be the Assistant Administrator General in
Kampala.[2]
In 1973, Idi Amin  fired his Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda , Peter Jam es
Nkambo Mugerwa , with the stated reason being that he could not keep up with the "supersonic speed"
that President Idi Amin was drivi ng the economy, leading him to appoint Godfrey Serunkuma Lule to
be his successor.[3]
As Minister of Justice and Constitutio nal Affairs of Uganda , a position that also made him the
Attorney General of Uganda, Lule dealt with the complicated legal justific ation of the unconstitutional
actions of the increasingly erratic Idi Amin.[3] He defended the 1975 Land Reform Decree 1975, which
overhauled the country's land tenure system by overturning the Public Lands Act of 1969 and
eliminating all private property  in Uganda and making all land in Uganda to be public land owned by
the government of Uganda , with  land leased to private enterprises from the government of Uganda.[7]
He also had to deal with the legal consequences the Expulsion of Asians from Uganda  where Idi Amin
ordered the deportation of 80,000 Ugandans of Indian Descent  from Uganda , adjudicating on what
happened to their property left behind when Uganda's South Asian Minority  was deported and
Ugandan citizens of Indian ancestry voluntarily left due to increased Indophobia  in Uganda.[8][9][10]
He also frequently travelled to Geneva , Switzerland  and other cities to defend the Idi Amin  regime to
international bodies and foreign governments.[3][11]
In March 1977, Lule was told over a lunch in Kampala that Idi Amin  was planning on ousting and
ultimately killing Lule, prompting Lule to leave the cafe where he was leaving and head directly to
London , home of a vibrant expatriate  Ugandan community of other prominent defectors  from  Idi
Amin like former long-time Idi Amin Minister of Finance Emmanuel Blayo Wakhwweya  two years
earlier, without even returning to his house in Kampala .[3]
He kept a low profile in his first months in London, with news of his defe ction only being reported on
10 April 1977,[12] and no mention was made in Uganda that he was missing and that he defected to the
United Kingdom  until July.[13][14] During this time he was attempting to get his family to join him in
London, avoiding the fate that othe r political spouses like Edith Mary Bataringaya  faced when their
spouses fell into the ill-will of Idi Amin, with Edith Mary Batari ngaya  being burned alive by Idi Amin
henchmen.[3][15][16][17]
In exile , Lule became a prominent critic of the Idi Amin  regime. In Septem ber 1977, he spoke to the
United Nations  and urged them to censure Amin's crimes against humanity.[18] He also appealed for
the United Kingdom , the United States , and European  nations to boycot t Idi Amin and his regime,
calling a press conference with ex-Minister of Health Henry Kyemba  where he urged the UnitedMinister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda
DefectionKingdom to stop allowing Idi Amin's "whiskey runs" where he would send cronies on flights to
London's Stansted  Airp ort to buy luxury goods for himself and supporters.[19] He also worked for
Hoskin and Company while in exile, working in Bournemouth  and London .[3]
In 1979, Idi Amin  fled into exile  mov ing to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia  while Godfrey Serunkuma Lule
returned from exile back to Uganda .[3]
In 1980, Lule form ed the law firm and consulting group Sebalu & Lule with Paulo Sebalu.[1] Sebalu &
Lule  Advocates and Legal Consultants is a Ugandan law firm headquartered in Kampala , the capital
city of Uganda.[1] The firm is a member of DLA Pipe r and the DLA Piper Africa Group.[20][21] The
firm's advocates are members of various professional bodies, including the International Bar
Association , the Com monwealth Lawyers Assoc iation, the East African Law Society  and the Uganda
Law Society .[20][21][1]
Sebalu & Lule advises leading local and multinational organisations across the financial services,
energy and infrastructure, insurance, telecommunications, construction, hospitality and leisure,
private equity and processing/manufacturing sectors, several of whom are listed on the Uganda
Securities Exchange  and FTSE 100 index . The firm also acts for industry regulators, international
financiers, the Government and governmental agencies.[22][23][24][25]
Sebalu & Lule specialises in the following practice areas: banking and finance, capital markets,
corporate and commercial law, commercial dispute resolution, projects and infrastructure, power
(energy, oil and gas and mining), mergers and acquisitions, employme nt and pensions, non-profit
organisations, real estate and tax.[22] The firm has had significant success under Lule, who is still
working as of 2019 , with the firm receiving numerous awards. In the 2014 IFLR1000's financial and
corporate law rankings for Sebalu & Lule indicate that it is a Tier 1 financial and corporate law firm.
The firm is also ranked as a Tier 1 energy and infrastructure law firm by the same legal directory.[26]
Sebalu & Lule was also ranked as a Band 1 Ugandan law firm in the 2014 edition of Chambers &
Partners.[21][27]
After returning to Uganda following his defection , Godfrey Serunkuma Lule initially kept a low profile
politically focusing  on working building up Sebalu & Lule  into a successful and prominent firm. He
did do pro-bono  work consulting for the new Uganda n political leadership, especially working for the
Indians of Uganda  returnin g to Uganda following the Expulsion of Asians from Uganda  under Idi
Amin , a decisi on that Lule worked to defend, litigate, and sort out when he was Minister of Justice
and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda .[3]
Lule would enter Buganda  politics from time to time throughout the 1990s and 2000s when the
Kabaka of Buganda  was close to Lule. The Kabaka of Buganda is the title given to the King of
Buganda, a subnational kingdom for the Ganda People  of Ugan da.[28][29] In 1993 , he helped in
negotiations to ensure that Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II wou ld be crowned, serving as his
deputy attorney general.[3]Return to Uganda and Private Practice
Sebalu & Lule
Bugandan Political Career post-AminIn 1994–1995, Lule helped write the new Buganda n Constitution.[3] Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi
dissolved the Lukiiko  in 1996 and appointed Lule to be Kampala's  repr esentative, although Lule
refused to serve over the lack of transparency.[3]
In 2005, Lule entered politics for a final time when he became the Bugandan attorney general when
his long time ally Dan Muliika was appointed Katikkiro of Buganda , the title for the prime minister of
the Kingdom of Buganda.[30][3] After Muliika was sacked Lule resig ned, citing his ailing heart. As of
2019, Lule continues to live in Kampala  and practice law and run Sebalu & Lule .[3]
